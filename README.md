# CodeHSTester
A super simple structure copy of CodeHS's Java development workspace for use in IDEs such as Intellij Idea or Eclipse.

### Motives
It's always mildly annoying when you're searching for a method that you know exists in Java but can't find it in CodeHS 
because there's no code completion. Fortunately, with the help of CodeHSTester, code from CodeHS can be copied directly
over to an IDE for use with code completion.

### What this project does
Honestly? Not much. It mirrors the few helper methods and classes seen in CodeHS Java courses but that's it. There's no
special help or anything, it's just so you have the ability to copy-paste code to an IDE and work on it there.

### How to use
1. In your IDE of choice, clone this repository into a project. This will be different for all IDEs, so if you haven't done it
before please use Google.
2. Find `CodeHSTester`, by default this class will be the class automatically ran with the main method in the `Main` class.
3. To match the current CodeHS project as closely as possible, if wanted, `CodeHSTester` can be renamed to whatever the name
of the class is in the CodeHS project.
4. If additional classes are provided in CodeHS, they can also easily be moved over by creating a new class and copy-pasting the
code form the additional class in there.
5. Run the main method in your IDE and your CodeHS code will run.
